Drop-a-Site
===========

"Drop-a-Site" is a small, boilerplate-like starter-kit for a simple site with URL-rewriting.

_______________________

**What do you use it for?**

Sometimes you happen to release a small site, that's too small to use a CMS or a PHP-framework, but you don't want to bother with static HTML-files as well. That's when you use "Drop-s-site".

It has a simple URL-rewriting and all your sites are represented by php-include-files.

**When not to use "Drop-a-Site"?**

When you are building a more complex site structure and want to include a news sections, a contact form, etc, you should rather use a CMS. Extending "Drop-a-Site" would be a waste of time. Others already completed the tasks you are confronted with.

**What else?**

I partly rely on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) for this project. Why? I like. But it's not fully integrated. Maybe I'll do this later.
